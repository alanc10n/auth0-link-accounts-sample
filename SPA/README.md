## Install Locally

1. Create an auth0-variables.js file with your Auth0 credentials. You can use auth0-variables.sample.js as a template. You can get the clientId and domain from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
2. In your App's configuration on the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com), add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**. 
3. Initialize a web server in the samples folder. You can do it for instance with `serve`:
	* Install node
	* run `npm install -g serve`
	* run `serve` in the project's folder to start a server
4. Go to the [index page](http://localhost:3000) and start playing with the app! 

## Running the App with Docker

To run the sample with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), make sure you have `docker` installed.

Follow steps 1 and 2 in the [Install Locally](#install-locally) section to set up the clientId and domain, then run `sh exec.sh` to build and run the Docker image.
